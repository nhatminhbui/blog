There's not really any normal way to start questioning the meaning of life. Some people don't know what they want to do with their existence. Boom, and they're just there already. Some people live their dreams and enjoy an ideal life until a "So why am I doing this?" puzzle comes along, making everything look boring. Or sometimes a little kid just accidentally sees a profound post on Instagram and keeps wondering for days. Is this adult life?

There's also not really any normal way to have a fair answer. Some say the meaning of life is to experience everything they can during this brief moment of existence. Some conclude that life has no meaning at all. Some people in Vietnam say the meaning of life is hidden in the number 69; they use this number to [đánh đề](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%E1%BB%91_%C4%91%E1%BB%81) every day, and there will be a day they suddenly become rich. The meaning of life is no doubt one of the most debatable topics, no matter who you are.

## So what's the point of living, eventually?

For thirteen billion years and a half, we have not existed. Now for a short while, we do. But why were we born as humans instead of a little cute pet, a tree, or a soft wind? This giving-by-nature body leads us to something we're proud of: we're the best species! Our brains are wired to be complicated enough to think, to invent, and to have purposes in life.

It made sense to me until I moved to the city. I took a seat in a coffee shop that gave me a view of people passing by. The rich, poor, young, old, men, women, boys, and girls—they were busily walking fast and slow. The definition of struggle has been struggling on their faces. They're just like me, trying to feed their family. Now what? We're not going to be the next Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. But even if that's the case, no one can be sure that the earth won't collapse upon itself. Everything contains the seeds of its own destruction. We're all going to die and disappear without a trace, aren't we?.

**It doesn't matter.** There's no explanation to why we are humans; it would make no difference if we were something else. We're born, we live, we struggle, we die. **Life has no meaning.**

But why don't we just simply commit suicide? Well, a meaningless life is not the same as an empty life. We live because we feel content. Albert Camus perfectly visualized that as Sisyphus:

Our lives are pretty much like this Sisyphus. He pushes the rock up a mountain, knowing that it will roll back down. We live, knowing that we will die one day. "The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart," Albert Camus wrote. The task of pushing the rock up itself has no meaning, but the struggle to push the rock up is enough for Sisyphus to feel content.

The absence of meaning in life doesn't matter, as long as we struggle to fill our lives with things that we are passionate about, to create useful stuff, and enjoy silly things that interest us. That's all that matters.
